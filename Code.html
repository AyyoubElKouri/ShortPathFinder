   Section: Introduction to Spring Framework

      Paragraph:  The Spring Framework is a powerful, feature-rich framework for building Java
                  applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing
                  Java applications easily and rapidly.

      Paragraph:  Key features of the Spring Framework include Inversion of Control (IoC),
                  Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and a robust ecosystem of projects that
                  extend its capabilities.

      Code[Java]:
                  // Example of a simple Spring Bean configuration using annotations
                  @Component               
                  public class HelloWorld {
                     public String sayHello() {
                        return "Hello, World!";
                     }
                  }

   <!-- Section 2: Setting Up a Spring Project -->
   Section: Setting Up a Spring Project

      Paragraph:  To set up a Spring project, you can use Spring Initializr, a web-based tool
                  that allows you to generate a Spring Boot project with the necessary
                  dependencies.

      Paragraph:  You can also manually add Spring dependencies to your Maven or Gradle
                  build files.

      Code[XML]: ```
                  // Example of adding Spring Boot Starter dependency in Maven
                  <dependency>
                     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
                     <version>2.5.4</version>
                  </dependency>
                  ```

   <!-- Section 3: Creating a Simple Spring Application -->
   Section: Creating a Simple Spring Application

      Paragraph:  A simple Spring application can be created by defining a main class with
                  the @SpringBootApplication annotation and running it.

      Item: Slowly build your application by adding components, services, and controllers
            as neede
      
      Item[warning]: Ensure that you have the necessary 'Spring' dependencies included in your
                     project to avoid runtime issues.

      Code[Java]:
                  ```
                  // Example of a simple Spring Boot application
                  @SpringBootApplication
                  public class MySpringApp {
                     public static void main(String[] args) {
                        SpringApplication.run(MySpringApp.class, args);
                     }
                  }
                  ```

   Section: Conclusion

      Paragraph:  The Spring Framework is a versatile and powerful tool for building Java
                  applications. By understanding its core concepts and setting up a basic project,
                  you can leverage its features to create robust applications efficiently.

      Paragraph:  Explore further by diving into Spring's extensive documentation and
                  community resources to enhance your knowledge and skills.

      Paragraph:  Happy coding with Spring!

Module: Java Configurations

   <!-- Section 1: Introduction to Java Configurations -->
   Section: Introduction to Java Configurations

      Paragraph:  Java-based configuration is a way to configure Spring applications using
                  standard Java classes instead of XML files. This approach leverages
                  annotations and type safety.

      Paragraph:  It allows for more flexibility and easier refactoring compared to XML
                  configurations.

      Code[Java]:
                  // Example of a Java configuration class
                  @Configuration
                  public class AppConfig {
                     @Bean
                     public MyService myService() {
                        return new MyServiceImpl();
                     }
                  }

   <!-- Section 2: Creating a Configuration Class -->
   Section: Creating a Configuration Class

      Paragraph:  To create a configuration class, annotate a Java class with @Configuration.
                  Inside this class, define methods annotated with @Bean to declare beans.

      Paragraph:  Each @Bean method returns an instance of the bean that will be managed by
                  the Spring container.

      Code[Java]:
                  // Example of defining multiple beans in a configuration class
                  @Configuration
                  public class AppConfig {
                     @Bean
                     public MyService myService() {
                        return new MyServiceImpl();
                     }

                     @Bean
                     public MyRepository myRepository() {
                        return new MyRepositoryImpl();
                     }
                  }

   <!-- Section 3: Using the Configuration Class -->
   Section: Using the Configuration Class

      Paragraph:  To use the configuration class, you can create an ApplicationContext using
                  AnnotationConfigApplicationContext and pass the configuration class as a parameter.

      Paragraph:  This will initialize the Spring container and register the beans defined in
                  the configuration class.

      Code[Java]:
                  // Example of initializing ApplicationContext with Java configuration
                  public class MainApp {
                     public static void main(String[] args) {
                        ApplicationContext context = 
                           new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
                        
                        MyService myService = context.getBean(MyService.class);
                        myService.performAction();
                     }
                  }
